# Zenon Network - Network of Momentum

> Educational landing site explaining Zenon Network's blockchain architecture featuring feeless transactions, parallel execution, dual-ledger design, and browser-based nodes.

Zenon Network is a Layer 1 blockchain that solves the blockchain bottleneck through a novel dual-ledger architecture where each account is its own blockchain. This enables parallel transaction processing, feeless operations via Dynamic Plasma, and the ability to run full nodes directly in web browsers.

## The Blockchain Bottleneck

**Why Every Chain Is Slow**

On traditional blockchains computers run the same code for every transaction. That's like asking every employee in a company to do the same task. Wasteful, slow, and expensive.

Key points:
- Every validator re-executes every transaction
- You pay fees because validators charge for their work
- The more users, the slower it gets

## The Insight

**A Fundamental Rethinking**

What if validators only checked that your answer was correct without redoing all the math? That's the insight behind Zenon.

Key points:
- You do the work on your device
- The network only verifies the result
- No redundant computation

## Dual-Ledger Architecture

**Your Account Is Your Blockchain**

In Zenon, every user has their own mini-blockchain in your browser. Your transactions don't compete with anyone else's. It's like having your own lane on the highway.

Key points:
- Account-chains: Your personal ledger
- Momentums: The global timestamp
- True Parallelism: No traffic jams

## Parallel Processing

**Everyone Moves at Once**

Traditional blockchains are like a single checkout lane. Zenon is like a supermarket where everyone has their own self-checkout.

Key points:
- No competing for block space
- Your speed doesn't depend on network load
- Scales naturally with users

## Dynamic Plasma

**No Fees. Ever.**

Gas fees exist because validators charge for their work. Since Zenon validators don't re-execute, there's no work to charge for. Simple.

Key points:
- No gas auctions
- No paying $50 for a simple transfer
- The network adapts to load without fees

## Browser Light Client

**Run a Node in Your Browser - Not a Light Client, A Real Peer**

Other blockchains require you to trust a server. On Zenon, your browser downloads a tiny amount of data and verifies everything itself. No middleman.

Key points:
- No Infura, no Alchemy, no trust
- Verify transactions yourself
- Instant onboarding—no 24-hour sync

## Deterministic Fact Acceptance (DFA)

**Proof, Not Replay**

Most blockchains re-watch the whole movie to check the ending. Zenon just checks the final frame is correctly signed. Same result, fraction of the work.

Key points:
- Facts are verified cryptographically
- No virtual machine at consensus
- Results are provable without re-computation

## zApps

**Execute Locally, Anchor Globally**

Run complex applications on your own device. When you're done, submit a cryptographic commitment to your account-chain. The network never runs your code, it just stamps your work.

Key points:
- Apps run in your browser
- Submit results, not code
- Instant execution, no network wait

## Cross-Chain Verification

**Connect Without Trusting**

Want to verify a Bitcoin transaction? Zenon can check it directly: no bridge operators, no wrapped tokens, no trust assumptions. Pure cryptography.

Key points:
- Verify Bitcoin transactions natively
- No bridge operators to trust
- True interoperability

## Node Architecture

**How It All Fits Together: Sentries → Sentinels → Pillars**

A layered system where execution happens on your device, spam is filtered in the middle, and consensus only handles ordering. Simple, elegant, scalable.

Key points:
- Sentries: Your device executes
- Sentinels: Filter and verify
- Pillars: Finalize the order

## The Vision

**The Network of Momentum - A New Foundation**

Imagine thousands of browser-based peers, running full applications, without fees, servers, or central infrastructure. That's not a dream. That's Zenon.

Key points:
- Sovereign users
- No central points of failure
- Built for the next century
