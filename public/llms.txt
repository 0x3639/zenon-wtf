# Zenon Network - Network of Momentum

> Educational landing site explaining Zenon Network's blockchain architecture featuring feeless transactions, parallel execution, dual-ledger design, and browser-based nodes.

Zenon Network is a Layer 1 blockchain that solves the blockchain bottleneck through a novel dual-ledger architecture where each account is its own blockchain. This enables parallel transaction processing, feeless operations via Dynamic Plasma, and the ability to run full nodes directly in web browsers.
